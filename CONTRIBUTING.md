## <a name="building"></a> Building and Testing

After cloning this repository (or a fork of it), you can build and run the tests for marklogic-unit-test locally 
via the following steps:

```
echo "mlPassword=your admin user password" > marklogic-junit5/gradle-local.properties
./gradlew test
```

The `test` task will both deploy a test application to your MarkLogic instance - assumed to be running at `localhost` - 
and run a set of tests with this application. The application will include a MarkLogic app server on port 8008, 
which is defined by the `mlRestPort` property in marklogic-unit-test-client/gradle.properties. Some tests in 
the marklogic-junit5 subproject will also hit the MarkLogic App-Services app server on port 8000.

After running `./gradlew test`, you can also point your browser at http://localhost:8008/test to access the 
marklogic-unit-test UI for running tests. 

## Testing the documentation locally

The docs for this project are stored in the `./docs` directory as a set of Markdown files. These are published via
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) using the
configuration found under "Settings / Pages" in this repository.

You can build and test the docs locally by
[following these GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll),
though you don't need to perform all of those steps since some files generated by doing so are already in the
`./docs` directory. You just need to do the following:

1. Install the latest Ruby (rbenv works well for this).
2. Install Jekyll.
3. Go to the docs directory - `cd ./docs` .
4. Run `bundle install` (this may not be necessary due to Gemfile.lock being in version control).
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You can then go to http://localhost:4000 to view the docs.

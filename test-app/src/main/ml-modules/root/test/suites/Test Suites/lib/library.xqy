  This file is not used at all.  It's here to ensure we don't accidentally read files in the lib directory and attempt
  to run them as a test.

  All files in a lib directory will be ignored by the test scanner.  This is a good place to add libraries that
  will be used by multiple tests, but don't belong as a main part of the application.
